A:
1. Intrauterine pregnancy at 28 weeks gestation, singleton, cephalic presentation
2. Gestational diabetes mellitus, well-controlled with diet
3. Advanced maternal age (36 years)
4. History of preeclampsia in previous pregnancy
5. Mild gestational hypertension (BP trending upward but not yet diagnostic for preeclampsia)
6. Mild anemia of pregnancy
7. Appropriate fetal growth, reassuring fetal surveillance

P:
DIABETES MANAGEMENT:
- Continue current diabetic diet and glucose monitoring 4x daily
- Target fasting glucose <95 mg/dL, 1-hour postprandial <140 mg/dL
- If glucose values consistently elevated (>2 abnormal values in 1 week), will initiate insulin therapy
- Dietitian follow-up in 2 weeks
- Continue prenatal vitamins with iron (for anemia)

PREECLAMPSIA SURVEILLANCE:
- Continue low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily
- Blood pressure monitoring: patient to check BP at home twice weekly, call if >140/90
- Watch for warning signs: severe headache, vision changes, right upper quadrant pain, decreased fetal movement
- Urine protein check at each visit
- Weekly BP checks starting at 32 weeks (in-office or home monitoring)

ANEMIA MANAGEMENT:
- Iron supplementation 325 mg ferrous sulfate daily (in addition to prenatal vitamin)
- Recheck hemoglobin at 32 weeks

FETAL SURVEILLANCE:
- Biweekly NST (non-stress test) starting at 32 weeks
- Growth ultrasound at 32 weeks and 36 weeks to monitor for macrosomia (large baby due to GDM)
- Kick counts daily starting now (at least 10 movements in 2 hours)

DELIVERY PLANNING:
- Plan for delivery at 39 weeks if well-controlled GDM and no complications
- If poor glucose control or development of preeclampsia, may deliver earlier (34-37 weeks depending on severity)
- Discuss delivery plan with patient: preference for vaginal delivery if no obstetric contraindications
- Plan for pediatric team at delivery due to maternal diabetes (risk of neonatal hypoglycemia)

NEXT VISIT:
- Return in 2 weeks (30-week visit)
- Labs: Recheck glucose log, urine protein
- Continue close monitoring through remainder of pregnancy

Patient counseled on warning signs of preeclampsia and when to call. Questions answered. Will call with any concerns before next scheduled visit.
