S:
Patient presents for comprehensive geriatric assessment and medication review. Accompanied by daughter. Patient reports increased fatigue over past 3 months, occasional dizziness when standing, and difficulty sleeping. Denies chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or falls.

A:
1. Polypharmacy (12 medications) with potential medication-related issues
2. Orthostatic hypotension, likely medication-induced (furosemide, metoprolol, lisinopril, tamsulosin)
3. Increased fall risk (orthostasis, gait instability, polypharmacy)
4. Mild cognitive impairment, stable (need to monitor for progression)
5. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, stable (NYHA Class II)
6. Hypertension, adequately controlled
7. Type 2 diabetes mellitus with suboptimal control (A1c 7.2%)
8. Chronic kidney disease stage 3, stable
9. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, stable on tamsulosin
10. Osteoarthritis of bilateral knees
11. Vitamin D insufficiency
12. Mild anemia of chronic disease

P:
MEDICATION OPTIMIZATION (Deprescribing and Adjustments):
1. **DISCONTINUE Diphenhydramine** - High-risk medication in elderly (anticholinergic, fall risk, cognitive impairment). Recommend non-pharmacologic sleep hygiene instead.
2. **REDUCE Furosemide** from 40 mg to 20 mg daily - Contributing to orthostasis, patient has minimal edema. Will monitor weight and symptoms.
3. **REDUCE Lisinopril** from 20 mg to 10 mg daily - Contributing to orthostasis, BP adequately controlled.
4. **CHANGE Metformin** from 1000 mg BID to 500 mg BID - Dose adjustment for CKD (eGFR 48), reduce GI side effects.
5. **CONTINUE** other medications as prescribed (metoprolol, spironolactone, atorvastatin, aspirin, tamsulosin, omeprazole, calcium/vitamin D, acetaminophen PRN)

VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTATION:
- Increase Vitamin D to 2000 IU daily (from current 800 IU)
- Start Vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily (low-normal level, may help with cognition)

FALL PREVENTION:
- Physical therapy referral for gait training and balance exercises
- Home safety evaluation by occupational therapy (remove throw rugs, install grab bars)
- Continue use of cane, consider walker if instability persists
- Educate patient to rise slowly from sitting/lying to prevent orthostatic symptoms
- Daughter to monitor for falls, encourage patient to wear medical alert device

COGNITIVE MONITORING:
- Referral to neurology for formal cognitive assessment (rule out early dementia)
- Avoid anticholinergic medications
- Encourage cognitive stimulation (reading, puzzles, social activities)
- Daughter educated on signs of worsening cognition

DIABETES MANAGEMENT:
- Goal A1c <7.5% for elderly patient with multiple comorbidities (less stringent to avoid hypoglycemia)
- Continue metformin at reduced dose
- Recheck A1c in 3 months
- Home glucose monitoring weekly (fasting)

KIDNEY FUNCTION:
- Monitor creatinine every 6 months
- Ensure adequate hydration
- Avoid NSAIDs (patient using acetaminophen, which is appropriate)

PREVENTIVE CARE:
- Pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) - due now, will administer today
- Influenza vaccine - due in October (schedule for next visit)
- Colorectal cancer screening up to date (last colonoscopy 2019, normal)
- Hearing aids: encourage consistent use

ADVANCE CARE PLANNING:
- Discussed goals of care with patient and daughter
- Patient has living will and healthcare proxy (daughter is proxy)
- Prefers to avoid hospitalization if possible, focus on quality of life
- Code status: DNR/DNI documented in chart

NEXT VISIT:
- Return in 1 month for blood pressure and orthostasis recheck after medication adjustments
- Labs in 3 months: BMP, A1c, CBC
- Consider geriatric care manager to help coordinate care

Patient and daughter counseled on medication changes, fall prevention strategies, and warning signs. Questions answered. Will call if any concerns.
