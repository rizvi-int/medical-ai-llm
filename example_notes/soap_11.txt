PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT:

**ADHD Treatment:**
- Start **Methylphenidate ER (Concerta) 18 mg once daily in the morning**
  - Rationale: First-line stimulant medication for ADHD, lower abuse potential than immediate-release formulations
  - Will titrate based on response and tolerability
  - Plan to increase to 27 mg after 1 week if tolerated and insufficient response
  - Target dose: 36-54 mg daily (will assess at follow-up)
  - Counsel patient on potential side effects: decreased appetite, insomnia, increased heart rate, anxiety
  - Advised to take in morning to avoid sleep interference
  - Contraindications reviewed: no cardiac disease, no uncontrolled hypertension

**Anxiety Management:**
- Start **Escitalopram (Lexapro) 10 mg once daily**
  - Rationale: SSRI for generalized anxiety disorder, may also help with depressive symptoms
  - Monitor for initial worsening of anxiety (may occur in first 1-2 weeks)
  - Full effect expected in 4-6 weeks
  - Counsel on side effects: nausea, headache, sexual dysfunction, activation
  - Advised not to discontinue abruptly

- **Avoid benzodiazepines** - High risk for dependence, not appropriate for long-term GAD management

**Vitamin D Supplementation:**
- Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily (low levels may contribute to mood symptoms)

NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:

**Psychotherapy:**
- Referral to psychologist for **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** focusing on:
  - ADHD coping strategies (organization, time management, task initiation)
  - Anxiety management (cognitive restructuring, exposure techniques)
  - Mindfulness-based stress reduction

**ADHD Coaching:**
- Consider ADHD coaching for workplace accommodations and organizational strategies
- Will provide letter for workplace accommodations if needed (extended deadlines, written instructions, quiet workspace)

- **Sleep hygiene:** Set consistent sleep schedule, limit caffeine after 2 PM, no screens 1 hour before bed
- **Exercise:** Recommend 30 minutes moderate exercise 5x/week (helps with ADHD symptoms and anxiety)
- **Nutrition:** Regular meal times, balanced diet, limit processed foods
- **Reduce caffeine intake** gradually to 1-2 cups daily (excessive caffeine may worsen anxiety)
- **Limit cannabis use** - May interfere with ADHD medication and worsen motivation

MONITORING:

**Follow-up Schedule:**
- Return in 2 weeks for medication titration and side effect monitoring
- Monthly visits for first 3 months to optimize medication regimen
- Then every 3 months for stable maintenance

**Safety Monitoring:**
- Baseline EKG (ordered today, due to stimulant initiation in patient with mild tachycardia)
- Blood pressure and heart rate at each visit while titrating stimulant
- Screen for suicidal ideation at each visit (SSRI black box warning in young adults)
