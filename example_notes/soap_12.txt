S:
Patient returns to endocrinology clinic for follow-up of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications. Diagnosed with diabetes 8 years ago, initially managed with lifestyle modifications and metformin, but A1c has been suboptimal (>8%) over past 2 years despite escalating therapy.

Current diabetes regimen: Metformin 1000 mg BID, Empagliflozin 25 mg daily, Insulin glargine (Lantus) 40 units at bedtime. Patient reports good adherence to medications. Checking blood glucose 2x daily (fasting and before dinner).

No severe hypoglycemic episodes. Occasional mild hypoglycemia (glucose 65-70 mg/dL) in late afternoon, treated with snack.

Reports 15 lb weight loss over past 3 months since starting empagliflozin (patient pleased with this). Following diabetic diet "most of the time" but admits to occasional fast food. Exercises 2-3x/week (walking 30 minutes). Denies polyuria, polydipsia, or polyphagia.

DIABETES MANAGEMENT - INTENSIFY THERAPY:

**Insulin Adjustment:**
- **Increase Insulin glargine from 40 units to 50 units at bedtime**
  - Rationale: Fasting glucose consistently 140-180 (goal <130)
  - Will reassess in 2 weeks based on glucose log
  - Further titration may be needed

**Add GLP-1 Receptor Agonist:**
- **Start Semaglutide (Ozempic) 0.25 mg subcutaneous once weekly**
  - Rationale: A1c >8% on basal insulin + metformin, need additional glucose lowering
  - GLP-1 agonists provide A1c reduction of 1-1.5%, weight loss benefit, cardiovascular protection
  - Titration schedule: 0.25 mg weekly x 4 weeks, then increase to 0.5 mg weekly
  - May increase to 1 mg weekly after 4 weeks at 0.5 mg if needed and tolerated
  - Counsel on side effects: Nausea (usually transient), diarrhea, risk of pancreatitis (rare)
  - Inject on same day each week, can be any day (patient chose Sundays)
  - Provided injection training, patient demonstrated correct technique

**Continue Current Medications:**
- Metformin 1000 mg BID
- Empagliflozin 25 mg daily (SGLT2 inhibitor for renal protection and additional glucose lowering)

**Target Goals:**
- A1c <7%
- Fasting glucose 80-130 mg/dL
- Pre-meal glucose <180 mg/dL

DIABETIC NEUROPATHY MANAGEMENT:

**Pain Control:**
- **Increase Gabapentin from 300 mg TID to 600 mg TID**
  - Current dose insufficient for symptom control
  - Titrate up slowly to minimize dizziness/sedation
  - Schedule: 300 mg in AM, 300 mg at noon, 600 mg at bedtime x 1 week
  - Then increase to 600 mg TID if tolerated
  - Maximum dose 3600 mg/day (may further increase if needed)

**Alternative if Gabapentin Insufficient:**
- Consider adding Duloxetine 30-60 mg daily (dual mechanism for neuropathic pain)
- Will reassess at next visit

**Foot Care Education:**
- Daily foot inspection (check for cuts, blisters, redness)
- Moisturize feet daily (but not between toes)
- Wear properly fitting shoes, avoid walking barefoot
- Trim toenails carefully or see podiatrist
- Report any wounds/injuries immediately
- Annual comprehensive foot exam by podiatrist (referral placed)

DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY MANAGEMENT:

**Blood Pressure Control:**
- **Continue Lisinopril 20 mg daily** (ACE inhibitor provides renal protection)
- Goal BP <130/80 for diabetic with CKD
- Monitor potassium and creatinine

**Kidney Protection:**
- Continue Empagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor shown to slow CKD progression in diabetes)
- Monitor eGFR every 6 months
- Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio every 6 months
- Avoid nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs, IV contrast without pre-hydration)

LIPID MANAGEMENT:

**Intensify Statin:**
- **Increase Atorvastatin from 40 mg to 80 mg at bedtime**
  - Goal LDL <70 mg/dL for diabetic with CKD (ASCVD risk equivalent)
  - Current LDL 95 mg/dL
  - Recheck lipid panel in 3 months

**Triglyceride Management:**
- Triglycerides 205 mg/dL (elevated)
- Address with improved glucose control, weight loss, diet modification
- If remains >200 after glucose control improved, consider adding Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa)

CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REDUCTION:

- **Continue Aspirin 81 mg daily** (primary prevention in diabetic with additional risk factors)
- ASCVD 10-year risk: 18.5% (elevated)
- Encouraged smoking cessation (quit 5 years ago, congratulated patient)
- Continue CPAP for sleep apnea (untreated OSA increases CV risk)

DIABETIC RETINOPATHY MONITORING:

- Continue annual dilated eye exams with ophthalmology
- Next exam due in 10 months
- Reinforce importance of glucose control to prevent progression

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS:

**Diet:**
- Referral to certified diabetes educator (CDE) for medical nutrition therapy
- Emphasize: Low glycemic index carbs, portion control, meal timing regularity (challenging with truck driving job)
- Limit saturated fat and sodium
- Increase fiber intake

**Exercise:**
- Goal: 150 minutes moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week
- Current: 60-90 min/week (walking)
- Encourage increase to 30 minutes daily
- Discuss strategies for exercise during long truck drives (rest stop walks, resistance bands in cab)

**Weight Loss:**
- Excellent progress with 15 lb loss
- Goal: Additional 10-15 lb weight loss (target BMI <30)
- GLP-1 agonist (semaglutide) will help with appetite suppression and weight loss

PATIENT EDUCATION:

- Reviewed diabetes complications and importance of tight glucose control
- Discussed hypoglycemia recognition and treatment (15-15 rule: 15g fast-acting carbs, recheck in 15 min)
- Provided glucose tablets and instructed to carry at all times
- Encouraged consistent glucose monitoring (fasting and pre-dinner)
- Consider continuous glucose monitor (CGM) if willing - will discuss at next visit
- Sick day management reviewed (maintain hydration, monitor glucose more frequently, call if unable to eat or glucose >300)

VACCINATIONS:

- Influenza vaccine - due in October (will administer at next visit)
- Pneumococcal vaccines up to date (PPSV23 given 2020)
- COVID-19 booster recommended (patient to follow up with PCP)

FOLLOW-UP:

**Next Appointments:**
- Return to endocrinology in **3 months** for A1c recheck and medication adjustment
- Labs prior to visit: A1c, CMP, lipid panel, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
- Bring glucose log to all visits

**Between-Visit Monitoring:**
- Call in 2 weeks with fasting glucose readings after insulin increase
- Report any hypoglycemia (glucose <70), nausea from GLP-1 agonist, or foot injuries immediately

**Referrals:**
- Certified diabetes educator (CDE) - urgent referral for nutrition counseling
- Podiatry - annual comprehensive foot exam
- Ophthalmology - continue annual follow-up (already established)
