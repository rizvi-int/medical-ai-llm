Rapid Strep Test (in-office): **NEGATIVE**

Monospot Test (heterophile antibody test): **POSITIVE**

Complete Blood Count (in-office):
- WBC: 14,500/µL (elevated, with lymphocytosis)
- Lymphocytes: 65% (elevated, normal 20-40%)
- **Atypical lymphocytes: 18%** (highly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis)
- Hemoglobin: 13.2 g/dL (normal)
- Platelets: 178,000/µL (normal)

Liver Function Tests (in-office):
- AST: 95 U/L (elevated, normal <35)
- ALT: 110 U/L (elevated, normal <35)
- Transaminitis consistent with infectious mononucleosis

A:
1. **Infectious Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr Virus infection)** - CONFIRMED
   - Clinical presentation: Severe pharyngitis, tonsillar exudates, fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly
   - Positive Monospot test
   - Atypical lymphocytosis (18% on CBC)
   - Transaminitis (elevated AST/ALT)

2. **Acute pharyngitis secondary to EBV** (not streptococcal - rapid strep negative)

3. **Splenomegaly secondary to EBV infection** (increased risk of splenic rupture)

4. **Mild dehydration** (secondary to decreased oral intake)

P:
SUPPORTIVE CARE (No specific antiviral treatment for EBV):

**Symptom Management:**
- **Ibuprofen 400-600 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain and fever** (continue current regimen, increase dose if needed)
- **Acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours as needed** (can alternate with ibuprofen for better symptom control)
- Avoid aspirin (risk of Reye's syndrome in viral infections, though rare in adults)

**Throat Care:**
- **Viscous lidocaine 2% oral solution** - swish and spit (or swallow) 15 mL every 4 hours as needed for severe throat pain
  - Numbs throat to allow eating/drinking
  - Caution: May impair swallowing reflex, start with small amounts
- Salt water gargles (1/2 tsp salt in 8 oz warm water) every 2-3 hours
- Throat lozenges or sprays (e.g., Chloraseptic)
- Humidifier at night

**Hydration and Nutrition:**
- **Increase oral fluid intake** - Goal: 2-3 liters/day
  - Water, electrolyte drinks (Gatorade, Pedialyte), popsicles, ice chips
- Soft, cool foods (applesauce, yogurt, smoothies, ice cream, mashed potatoes)
- Avoid acidic or spicy foods (may irritate throat)

**Rest:**
- **Strict rest for at least 1 week** (no work)
- Anticipate need for 2-3 weeks total before feeling back to normal
- Fatigue may persist for several weeks to months

**CRITICAL: AVOID CONTACT SPORTS AND HEAVY LIFTING:**
- **Absolute restriction from contact sports, heavy lifting, or strenuous physical activity for 4-6 weeks**
  - Rationale: Splenomegaly significantly increases risk of splenic rupture (can be life-threatening)
  - No gym, no running, no lifting >10 lbs
  - Avoid abdominal trauma of any kind
- Patient counseled on seriousness of this restriction

**AVOID ANTIBIOTICS:**
- **Do NOT use amoxicillin or ampicillin**
  - These antibiotics cause a characteristic maculopapular rash in >90% of patients with EBV
  - Rash can be severe and uncomfortable
  - Since rapid strep test is negative, no indication for antibiotics

**Infection Control:**
- EBV is transmitted via saliva ("kissing disease")
- Avoid kissing, sharing drinks/utensils, sharing food
- Patient can shed virus for several weeks to months
- Roommates should be aware, but if already exposed (roommate had similar illness 2 weeks ago), likely already infected

MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP:

**Warning Signs - Instruct patient to seek emergency care if:**
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (can indicate airway obstruction from severe tonsillar swelling)
- Severe abdominal pain, especially left upper quadrant (could indicate splenic rupture)
- Inability to swallow liquids or severe dehydration
- Persistent high fever >5 days or fever that returns after improving

**Routine Follow-Up:**
- Return to urgent care or see PCP in **1 week** for reassessment
- If symptoms worsen before then, return sooner or go to ED
- Repeat liver function tests in 2-4 weeks (if not improved, may need hepatology referral)

**Return to Work:**
- Patient to remain out of work for at least **1 week** (work note provided)
- May return to work when fever-free for 24 hours without medication AND able to eat/drink normally
- Anticipate 7-10 days off work
- No restrictions on work after that, but avoid close contact with others' drinks/food

**Return to Physical Activity:**
- **No strenuous activity or contact sports for 4-6 weeks**
- May return to light activity (walking) after 2 weeks if feeling better
- Before returning to contact sports or heavy exercise, should follow up with PCP for repeat abdominal exam to ensure spleen is no longer enlarged
- Consider ultrasound to confirm spleen size normalization before clearance for contact sports (optional, at PCP discretion)

PATIENT EDUCATION:

- Explained diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (EBV infection)
- Reviewed natural course: Symptoms peak at 1 week, gradually improve over 2-3 weeks, but fatigue may last longer
- Emphasized **CRITICAL importance of avoiding contact sports/heavy lifting** due to splenomegaly and rupture risk
- Explained that this is a viral infection with no specific treatment, only supportive care
- Reviewed when to seek emergency care
- Provided written instructions

PRESCRIPTIONS:
1. Viscous lidocaine 2% solution, 100 mL, swish and spit/swallow 15 mL every 4 hours as needed for throat pain

OVER-THE-COUNTER RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Ibuprofen 400-600 mg every 6 hours PRN
- Acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours PRN
- Throat lozenges (Chloraseptic, Cepacol)
- Electrolyte drinks

Patient verbalized understanding of diagnosis, management plan, and activity restrictions. Particular emphasis placed on avoiding contact sports due to splenic rupture risk. Patient agreed to follow up in 1 week or sooner if concerning symptoms. Emergency precautions reviewed.
