- HR: 72 bpm
- Temp: 36.8°C (afebrile - important, rules out infection)
- Weight: 88 kg
- O2 saturation: 98% on room air

General: Well-appearing male, ambulating with crutches and knee brace, no acute distress

RIGHT KNEE EXAMINATION:

**Inspection:**
- **Moderate effusion (swelling)** present, decreased compared to 1-week post-op visit
- **4 arthroscopic portal incisions** (anteromedial, anterolateral, superolateral, medial for meniscus repair) - all well-healed, no erythema, no drainage
- **Vertical incision over pes anserinus** (hamstring harvest site, ~4 cm) - well-healed with steri-strips in place, no signs of infection
- No ecchymosis (bruising minimal and resolving)
- Mild quadriceps atrophy compared to left leg (expected post-op)

**Palpation:**
- No warmth over joint or incisions
- Non-tender along incisions
- Mild tenderness with palpation of joint line (medially > laterally, likely related to meniscus repair)
- No palpable fluid wave (effusion moderate but not tense)

**Range of Motion (ROM):**
- Extension: 0 degrees (full extension achieved - EXCELLENT)
- Flexion: 95 degrees (actively), 100 degrees (passively with gentle overpressure)
- Goal by 2 weeks: 0-90 degrees - **GOAL MET AND EXCEEDED**
- No pain with ROM, just tightness at end range

**Strength:**
- Quadriceps: 3/5 strength (can perform straight leg raise with good quad contraction, no extensor lag)
- Hamstring: 4/5 strength (limited by graft harvest site)
- Ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion: 5/5

**Special Tests:**
- Lachman test: Not performed (too early post-op to stress graft)
- Anterior drawer: Not performed (too early post-op)
- Patellofemoral tracking: Normal, no crepitus

**Neurovascular:**
- Sensation intact in saphenous nerve distribution (medial leg/foot - at risk with medial meniscus repair)
- Dorsalis pedis pulse 2+ (normal)
- Capillary refill <2 seconds
- No calf tenderness, negative Homan's sign (low concern for DVT)

LEFT KNEE (comparison): No swelling, full ROM, 5/5 strength, stable

GAIT:
- Ambulating with bilateral axillary crutches
- Weight-bearing as tolerated on right leg with knee brace locked in extension
- Gait pattern: Step-to gait, appropriate use of crutches
- No antalgic gait when bearing weight

X-rays (taken today - 2 weeks post-op):
- AP and lateral views of right knee
- **ACL femoral and tibial tunnel placement: Excellent position, anatomic**
- **Bioabsorbable interference screws well-seated**
- No fracture, no hardware complication
- Joint space preserved
- Small joint effusion visible (consistent with exam)

A:
1. **Status post right knee ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft, 14 days post-op - EXCELLENT early recovery**
   - Surgical site healing well, no signs of infection
   - ROM exceeds 2-week goal (0-95 degrees active, goal was 0-90)
   - Appropriate post-op swelling and pain, both improving
   - X-rays show excellent graft tunnel placement and hardware position

2. **Status post medial meniscus repair** (posterior horn, inside-out technique)
   - Healing well, mild tenderness expected
   - Following meniscus repair protocol (protected weight-bearing)

3. **Post-operative pain, well-controlled with oral opioids** (decreasing usage, appropriate for 2 weeks post-op)

4. **Quadriceps atrophy, mild** (expected after knee surgery, improving with PT)

5. **No evidence of post-operative complications**:
   - No infection (afebrile, no erythema/drainage at incisions, normal WBC - not checked today but no clinical concern)
   - No DVT (no calf pain/swelling, negative Homan's, on aspirin prophylaxis)
   - No graft failure or hardware complication
   - No neurovascular compromise

P:
POST-OPERATIVE REHABILITATION PLAN:

**Current Phase: Phase 1 (Weeks 0-4) - Protect Graft, Restore ROM and Quad Function**

**Weight-Bearing:**
- Continue **weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches**
- May wean off crutches over next 1-2 weeks as quadriceps strength and gait normalize (no limp)
- **Continue knee brace locked in extension for ambulation** until quad strength improves (able to perform straight leg raise without extensor lag)
- May unlock brace for sitting and sleeping

**Range of Motion Goals:**
- **Excellent progress** - already at 95 degrees flexion (ahead of schedule)
- Goal by 4 weeks post-op: 0-120 degrees
- Continue ROM exercises: heel slides, prone hangs, wall slides
- May begin stationary bike (high seat, no resistance) when ROM reaches 110 degrees

**Strengthening:**
- Continue current exercises: quad sets, straight leg raises, ankle pumps
- Add: standing hamstring curls, mini squats (0-45 degrees), heel raises
- Emphasis on quadriceps activation and reducing atrophy
- No resistance exercises for hamstring (protect graft donor site for first 6 weeks)

**Physical Therapy:**
- Continue PT 3x/week
- Good progress noted by therapist
- Will advance to Phase 2 exercises at 4 weeks post-op

**PAIN MANAGEMENT:**

- **Wean opioid medication** (currently taking oxycodone ~3 times/day, appropriate reduction)
- Plan to transition to non-opioid pain management:
  - **Ibuprofen 600 mg every 6-8 hours with food** (start now, alternate with remaining oxycodone)
  - **Acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours** (can use in combination with ibuprofen)
  - **Oxycodone 5 mg PRN for breakthrough pain** (use sparingly, goal to discontinue by 3-4 weeks post-op)
  - Refill: Oxycodone 5 mg #15 tablets (NO further refills - patient should transition to NSAIDs)

**DVT PROPHYLAXIS:**

- **Continue aspirin 325 mg twice daily for total of 4 weeks post-op** (2 more weeks)
- Low risk for DVT given young age, mobile, no other risk factors
- Encourage ankle pumps and ambulation

**MENISCUS REPAIR PROTOCOL (Important - affects rehab timeline):**

- Due to meniscus repair, must follow more conservative protocol than isolated ACL reconstruction
- **Protected weight-bearing for 6 weeks total** (continue current protocol)
- **No squatting beyond 90 degrees for 3 months** (protects meniscus repair)
- **No running until 4 months post-op** (vs. 3 months for isolated ACL)
- Meniscus repair increases long-term success if it heals properly

**INCISION CARE:**

- **Remove steri-strips at 3 weeks post-op** (next week) if not already fallen off
- May shower normally (already cleared at 1-week visit)
- No submersion in water (bath, pool, hot tub) until 4 weeks post-op
- Apply silicone scar gel to incisions starting at 3 weeks to minimize scarring (optional, cosmetic)

**RETURN TO ACTIVITY TIMELINE:**

Given meniscus repair, timeline is extended compared to isolated ACL reconstruction:

- **Weeks 4-12:** Phase 2 - Restore normal gait, increase strength, begin proprioceptive training
  - Wean off brace and crutches
  - Progress to full weight-bearing
  - Increase ROM to full (0-135+ degrees)
  - Advance strengthening (leg press, step-ups, lunges)

- **Months 3-6:** Phase 3 - Advanced strengthening, sport-specific training
  - Begin running program at 4 months (if cleared)
  - Agility drills, plyometrics starting at 4-5 months

- **Months 6-9:** Phase 4 - Return to sport
  - Return to sport-specific training at 6 months if criteria met:
    - Full ROM
    - >85% strength compared to uninvolved leg
    - Pass functional tests (hop tests, agility tests)
  - Full return to basketball at 9-12 months (conservative timeline due to meniscus repair and basketball's high demands)

**FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE:**

- **Next visit: 6 weeks post-op** (4 weeks from today)
  - Will reassess ROM, strength, gait
  - Transition to Phase 2 rehabilitation
  - Recheck X-rays to assess graft tunnel healing (standard protocol)

- **Subsequent visits:** 12 weeks, 6 months, 1 year

**RED FLAGS - Patient instructed to call or go to ED if:**
- Fever >101°F (concern for infection)
- Increasing redness, warmth, drainage from incisions
- Severe pain not controlled with medication
- Calf pain, swelling, warmth (DVT concern)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath (PE concern - rare but serious)
- Sudden giving way or instability of knee (graft failure - very rare)

PATIENT EDUCATION:

- Congratulated patient on excellent early recovery and ROM progress
- Reviewed extended timeline due to meniscus repair (9-12 months to basketball vs. 6-9 for isolated ACL)
- Emphasized importance of:
  - Continued PT compliance
  - Not rushing return to sport (graft needs time to mature, typically takes 12+ months for full strength)
  - Proper biomechanics and landing technique when returns to sport (reduce re-tear risk)
- Discussed that ACL graft failure rate is ~5-10%, lower in older athletes and with proper rehab
- Encouraged patience - this is a marathon, not a sprint

PRESCRIPTIONS:
1. Oxycodone 5 mg #15 tablets, take 1-2 tablets every 6 hours as needed for pain, NO REFILLS
2. Aspirin 325 mg #42 tablets, take 1 tablet twice daily, continue for 2 more weeks (DVT prophylaxis)

OVER-THE-COUNTER:
- Ibuprofen 600 mg every 6-8 hours with food
- Acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours

DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT:
- Continue use of knee brace (DonJoy or equivalent) locked in extension for ambulation
- May discontinue crutches when able to walk without limp and perform straight leg raise without extensor lag (likely 1-2 weeks)

Physical Therapy: Continue current plan, 3x/week, advancing per protocol

Patient verbalized understanding of rehabilitation timeline, activity restrictions, and warning signs. Questions answered. Motivated and compliant with therapy. Prognosis for full recovery and return to basketball is excellent.
